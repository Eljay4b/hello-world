'''
a) [10 pts] Instantiate the Stat class with a constructor that accepts a list of integers.

Each instantiated object should have two attributes: length and items. 

The length returns the number of elements of the object, and the items attribute returns the content of the list.

For example, if objStat = Stat([5, 3, 7, 3, 6, 4, 5, 8, 2, 9, 3, 4, 20, -10])
then the length should be 14 and the items [5, 3, 7, 3, 6, 4, 5, 8, 2, 9, 3, 4, 20, -10]
